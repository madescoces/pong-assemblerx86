## Mis aportes
Addressing the flickering issue caused by the 'int 10h' image interrupt by implementing a double buffer. Contributing to the graphics system development and collaborating on the movement system for paddles and the ball. Also, actively involved in the timer development

## Aprendizajes 
Addressing issues without the availability of extensive documentation and researching the inherent functioning of hardware in low-level languages. A fun and challenging project completed within a short timeframe.

## Instrucciones para compilar
The game can be compiled in a DOS virtual machine using TASM. Simply run the .bat file in the virtual machine, which compiles the game along with its subroutines and executes it.
